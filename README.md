openssl aes might have a small leak or hole

# polymorphic-encryption
a basic theory of a possible polymorphic-encryption

between the private key and public code block 

the public block would constantly change similar to a OTP (one time pin with 6 or 8 digits) style personal key
but for a public encrypted block of code that constantly changes but retains its private key solve

which could constantly change on the public block side of the encrypted code IN ORDER TO BUILD ENTROPY

the more mathematical entropy a system has the more difficult it is to solve or brute force with mathematical guessing

# Todo expanded theory
if this was physically in motion and MATHEMATICALLY solvable to decrypt big Prime as theory concept art below

just a concept theory of an ever changing block of an encrypted block doing a polymorphic mathematical evolutionary process to avoid decrypt to prevent and make big Prime from being revealed which would release the secret private key encoded in numerical primes
similar to one time password of skipping visual guess through mathematical polymorphism of ever changing one time pin keys but this concept art below mimics a possible real world design
